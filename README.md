## Key Findings
1. **Improved Awareness and Motivation**:
   - Students and teachers exhibited a 15-20% increase in motivation to reduce plastic usage post-program.
   - Awareness of plastic pollution's effects on ecosystems and health rose significantly.

2. **Waste Composition Insights**:
   - The majority of collected waste consisted of single-use plastics, cigarette butts, and food wrappers, underscoring the need for targeted reduction strategies.

3. **Geographic and Demographic Insights**:
   - Schools from 12 provinces participated, with Ontario and New Brunswick contributing the highest number of responses.
   - Younger students (8-10 years old) demonstrated the highest levels of engagement.

4. **Program Effectiveness**:
   - Schools with consistent participation showed sustained improvements in motivation and awareness.

## Recommendations
1. **Expand Reach**:
   - Target underrepresented provinces and regions for increased participation.
2. **Enhance Data Tracking**:
   - Adopt robust tracking methods for pre- and post-survey responses to ensure data accuracy.
3. **Introduce Follow-Up Modules**:
   - Provide continuous learning opportunities post-cleanup for sustained behavioral change.
4. **Empower Teachers**:
   - Offer workshops and certification programs to integrate environmental education more effectively.
